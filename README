3DSP - 3D Selection Problem

This application is an exploration into the iPad's gyroscope and accelerometer features	and their
usefulness in "dead reckoning" navigation applications.	Of the online sources I have encountered
discussing these iPad features, all of them mention that dead reckoning applications are feasible
but no one has provided sample code or even mentioned existing applications that perform this 
task. This application is a from-scratch dead reckoning navigation system for selecting objects
or sub-sections of complex objects in virtual space.
